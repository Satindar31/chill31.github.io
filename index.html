    <h1><br />Welcome!</h1>
    <h2>You just landed at the official website of youtuber "Legendgaming 31"!<br /><br /></h2>

    <p id="general_info_heading">General Info</p>
    <p id="general_info">Hello!<br />Supposing you're here and reading this, You might want to read below and know why I started started a youtube channel.<br /><br />Ok, so, I started this channel for fun, and did not know how to play games properply, or how to make good videos, edit videos, or anything which would help my channel grow, I still am not a master at games, or editing videos, but hey, at least I know the basics ðŸ˜€<br />I would appreciate people subscribing but I don't really care, I was inactive for a few months, and some of my subscribers unsubscribed, people started leaving bad comments, I think you got it, but I wasn't about to quit, even when my own friends started booing me for creating bad videos and bad editing.<br />Enough about my channel, let's see how much I know myself ðŸ¤”:<br />I'm not 18 yet, I'm decent at minecraft bedrock pvp and other minecraft things, I also play the java edition of minecraft, but I'm not good at bridging or pvp in the java version. I like to code ( I made this website myself, no kidding ) in html, css, and javascript, I started learning python but I got bored.<br />I have a gaming laptop, gaming mouse and a gaming headset, for gaming obviously. I use discord to talk to my friends, code helping, having fun, etc. You can find my discord in the Social Media Dropdown with my other social media accounts, also, on the top right, you can see my channel's logo, when you click on it, it should redirect you to my channel.<br /> That's pretty much all you would want to know about me, and no, I'm not doing a voice or face or anything reveal anytime soon.</p>
