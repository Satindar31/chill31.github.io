    <h1><br />Games</h1>
    <p id="startup">Here you will find all games which I normally play, and why I like them!<br /><br /></p>
    <p id="actp">Ok, so, You already read in the home page that I play Minecraft bedrock and java, and I'm decent at both of the versions, but rather than minecraft, I play a few other games like call of duty, clash royale, clash of clans, etc. I don't pay much attention to call of duty because it's not very interesting now, even though it got some good updates which attracted more people into the game, but I really don't think of it as that interesting as the other games I play. now, you might be thinking, why do I still play clash royale and clash of clans. I like these games because they help me pass time and actually have fun, because playing minecraft and coding all day isn't good for a person. Clash Royale is a fun card game with lots of other interesting things, like clan wars, tournaments, challenges, 2v2's, etc. You can find their website given below, And clash of clans is an interesting village game where you build and protect your village, level up heroes, troops, buildings and attack other people's bases ( website given below ). These two games are made by supercell ( website given below ). Call of duty was a fun game made by activision team, It was for fun for me 'cuz I really liked playing action games, especially those with guns, multiplayer, battle royale, etc. I kinda still like them, but as I said, I lost interest in call of duty and games like them. You might like it, so it's website will also be given below!<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
